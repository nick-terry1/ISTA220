## Proposed Project

  The project idea I chose from the my originally submitted writeup was the quiz idea. The Adventure style game was too easy for a project,
   and the RPG type game was too hard and I wouldn't even come close to finishing it this class. Quiz is a hard project to do but not so hard that I wouldnt be able to 
   finish it by the end of the class.  
     ##### General Idea
	 The overall idea is a quiz app with a GUI interface where upon opening the app, the user is met with a page that asks whether he would like 
	 to either "create a quiz" or "start the quiz" with the choice being chosen by two buttons. If the user picks the create button 
	 it will set a boolean value to false. This boolean value is binded to the read only property of the textbox on page one. 
	 It will also take you to page one. The start quiz button will only take you to page one, without changing the boolean 
	 variable from its default false value.
