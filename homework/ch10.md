1. An array in memory looks like a contiguous block or memory (all memory addresses are sequential).  

2. Memory allocated to hold an array is on the heap.  

3. The array reference is allocated on the stack.  

4. An array can only hold values of the same type, if theres mixed types input into an array the compiler will try to convert the types if possible. For example int to double. String to double is impossible.  

5. Syntax for a foreach command is: foreach (int element in arrayname);  

6. You make a deep copy of an array by creating a new instance of the array and copying each location in the array by looping through it. You can also use the System.Array.CopyTo method.  

7. The difference might just be conceptual. A multidimensional array can be accessed like this: Array[0,2] but you access an array of arrays like Array[0][2] 

8. You can flatten a multidimensional array by using nested for loops like this:  

int count = 0;  
int[] newArray = new int[n*n];  
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) // where n is the size of the array  
  {  
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)  
  {  
    
	newArray[count] = oldArray[i,j];  
	count++;  
	
}  
}
