1. A class is a collection of similar information as a meaningful entity. According to a book a class arranges information.  

2. Two purposes of encapsulation are 1 to combine methods and data within a class and 2 to control the accessibility of the methods and data.  

3. You instantiate an instance of a class by using the new keyword to create an object for example: SampleClass objName = new SampleClass(); You can access this class by 
making it public.  

4. The default is private. Change it by writing another access modifier in front of it.  

5. Syntax for writing a constructor is using the class type and the paranthesis like so:  
Class c;  
c = new Class();  // this can all be done on one line like I did on question 3.  

6. Class fields and methods are different from instance fields and methods in that not all methods belong to an instance of a class and are independent. 
You dont need to create an object everytime you call a WriteLine(). You create a class field or method using a static keyword.  

7. You bring a static class in scope by static using statements. This way you dont need to preface the static member with the class name.  

8. A good reason to create an anonymous class might be to keep the name of the class a secret for security reasons.  

9. Polymorphism is one interface with multiple functions.  

10. Message passing is when the recieving object decides what to do with the message.  

11. The first object oriented programming language was Simula in 1967 according to Quora.com.  

12. Alexander Stepanov developed the C language and advocated generic programming. Thats the opposite of object oriented programming.
