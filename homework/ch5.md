1. A compound assignment operator is an operator that does an operator function and also assigns that value to the variable being operated on. It works by separating a variable and constant with the compound assignment operator, completes the operation between the two, then sends the final value into the variable.  
2. All the compound assignment operators are: *=, /=, %=, +=, -=  
3. Two ways to increment a variable by 5: first way: var += 5; second way: var + 5 = var2; var2 = var;
 two ways to decrement a variable by 50: first way: var -= 50; second way: var - 50 = var2; var2 = var;
4. A while loop will run as long as the condition is still being met.
5. If the loop variable never changes the loop will run forever.
6. for has three parts. You can omit any of them. If you omit all of them the loop will run forever.
7. You can guarantee that a loop runs at least once by using a do while loop which starts with the statements and ends with the check.
8. Break leaves the loop.
9. Continue immediately starts the loop over again.
