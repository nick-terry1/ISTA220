1. A local variable is a name that you declare in your program.
2. A statement is a command that does something. (has a ; at the end)
3. Identifiers are names that you use to identify different parts  of your program, like namespaces and classes.
4. A variable is a named location in memory.
5. A method is a collection of statements, or a named location in memory that references a behavior.
6. yes they are the same
7. Arithmatic operators change the values of the variable but keep the type.
8. Use the method: int interval = intVal.ToString()
9. Use the method: string stringVal = stringVal.Parse()
10. Precedence relates to different operators and how they relate to the order of operations, assossiativity is where two operators of equal precidence and the precidence can be overwritten with assossiativity or paranthesis.
11. Definate assignment rule is when you assign a value first to a variable and define it as another variable. The assignment happens from right to left. 
12. Prefix before the variable increments it first then computes, postfix computes and then incriments.
13. String interpolation is adding strings together using the $ operator at the beginning of the string.
14. Var declares a variable but lets the program figure out the type based on the initiated value.
