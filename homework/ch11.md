1. You define a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments by using the params keyword:  void Method(params int[] a) 

2. You call a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments by inserting any number of arguments into the parenthesis: Method(a,b,c,...,n); 

3. You cant use an array to pass an argument to a method because the params keyword doesnt work on multidimensional arrays and that is what you would make. 

4. A method can have as many parameters as the programmer wants up to the memory limit using the params keyword. 

5. The parameters need to be the same type unless using object[] which will accept anything. 

6. The difference is with optional parameters you NEED to pass that many arguments, however many it is. Params methods can have infinate. 

7. You define a method that takes arbitrary and different types of parameters with Method(object[])
