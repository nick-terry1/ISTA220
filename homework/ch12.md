1. Inheritance keeps you from writing the same variables for items that are related.  

2. Syntax is:  
class Derivedclass : Baseclass  

3. Yes, all user defined classes inherit from System.Object  

4. If you dont have a default constructor in the base class the compiler will automatically generate one for you.  

5. Yes only if the base class shares the variable with the derived class. 

6. No, because the derived classes are different types and wont have all the same variables.  

7. Yes because the base class has all the variables of the derived class.  

8. You might want to use the new keyword in a derived class when you have a method of the same name in the base class but the two methods are unrelated.  

9. A virtual method is a method that is meant to be overwritten, like ToString().  

10. Override uses the override method over other methods with the same name. If you have two different methods that are somewhat related, use the override keyword instead of new. 

11. You define an extension method in a static class and use the 'this' keyword in front of the type. 

12. You would use the extension method to have it apply to all the type variables within your code.
