C# CHAPTER 3 HOMEWORK

1. A method is a named location in memory that references a behavior

2. A return statement ends the method, and can either return a value // return(ans);
, or not // return;

3. An expression bodied method is a method that is only a single line and has
 the " => " operator

4. The scope of a variable is the area that a variable can be used and has been declared. 
If its outside the curly brackets than that variable can't be used.

5. An overloaded method is a method that has two identifiers with the same named

6. You call a method with arguments by using the method name like normal,
but you put variable names in the parenthesis.

7. You can write a method definition that requires parameter list by
writing in default parameters just in case the user forgets to enter a value.

8. I parameter specify as optional by giving a default value. If I dont
enter a value for the parameter when calling a method then it automatically
puts in the default.

9. A parameter is named if it has the name of the variable and a colon and value to use.
