1. A console application is a text based program with no UI
2. Main() tells the program where to start (must be proceded with static)
3. Namespaces seperate items like classes so that you dont confuse two different items with the same name.
4. Using allows a program to reference namespaces without having to write out the full length name of the class or namespace every time.
5. An assembly is a file that has a database of classes to use at your discretion and is partitioned by like items.
6. The relationship is that an assembly can have multiple namespaces and those namespaces can be defined in many different assemblies.
7. A graphical app has a gui unlike a cosole app and is for designing code for phones and such.
8. The starting point is in the app.xaml.cs file, the code is public app()
9. Built makes sure that the program will run succesfully & turns it into an assembly.
10. Debug runs the program as a test.
