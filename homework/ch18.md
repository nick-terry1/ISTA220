1. Queue - because its first in first out. 

2. Stack - because its last in first out. 

3. Linked List - because it puts the inserts in order and doesnt need to delete or query it hardly ever. 

4. Array - because the size of the structure never changes. 

5. Hashset - because no person would have the same name combination. 

6. Dictionary - because two people may have the same passwords but the username or keys would all be different. 

7. Lamda expressions are shorter method calls and are easier to read than regular methods. ex. x => x * x 

8. Lamda expressions are shorter anonymous methods need the delegate keyword. Theres no advantage of anonymous methods to lamda expressions.
