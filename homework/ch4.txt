C# ch4

1. All possible values for boolean expressions are true, and false

2. Eight boolean operators are as follows:
== equals, ! not, < less than, > greater than, && and, || or, <= less than or equal, >= greater than or equal.
Also one more that isnt in the book ^ exclusive or

3. Difference between short circuiting is that if the expression has a definate answer before the full expression is read, the program doesnt continue to test the parameters but skips to the next part in the program.

4. Operator with the highest precidence is ++ or -- or (). Lowest precidence is =. 

5. With regards to the if else statement curly braces encapsulate the statements to be executed should the function return true or false.

6. If you omit break in a switch statement the program will fall through to the next case.
