1. The difference between managed and unmanaged is an unmanaged resource means its not going to get destroyed and managed resources are ready to get garbage collected.  

2. Memory is allocated with new keyword. Its deallocated when a destructor is used.  

3. A destructor takes away the reference to a place in memory that will never be referenced again.  

4. Difference in syntax is a tilde in front of the destructor.  

5. Scarce resources are memory, database connections, and file handles. You want to manage them because they are valuable and cant wait for the garbage collector to release them whenever.  

6. Exception safe disposal is when the disposal method is called even if there was an exception, by using it in the finally block. 

7. Using statement works by disposing all resources inside the using block as soon as the using block ends. 

8. If you try to dispose of something already disposed of you could get an exception error.  

9. Maybe threads are able to dispose resources while running other code at the same time.

10. You shouldnt force the garbage collector because its an expensive process and the computer knows when you need to dispose something like when youre low on memory or when the program ends and itll do it automatically for you. 
The exception to this rule is if youre dealing with large data sets like multidimensional arrays and need to dispose of them as soon as possible.
